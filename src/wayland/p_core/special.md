# Special objects

Some objects of this protocol are special, and don't belong in the hierarchy of a global.

You already know two of them: `wl_display` and `wl_registry`.

## The Display

The `wl_display` represents the connection from a client to the compositor. It is automatically
created upon creation of the connection, and can be used by the client to create the `wl_registry`
and manage the dispatching of events.

It also receives any protocol error generated by the client, allowing a diagnostic of what happened
(but not recovery from it).

## The Registry

The `wl_registry` is the gate to all other globals. Upon creation, it receives as events the list of
all existing globals, as well as notification during the whole life of the client whenever a new
global is created or destroyed.

The client can instantiate the registry several times. In this case, each instance will be notified
of all globals.

## The Callback

The `wl_callback` object is created whenever a client asks the compositor to do something and
requires to be notified when it is done. The callback object has no requests and a single event:
`wl_callback::done`, which is called exactly once, when the task is finished.

For example, the request `wl_display::sync` requires the composior to fire the callback just when it
processed the request. It must process the requests in the same order as it receives them, which
guarantees that all pending requests sent before this sync have been processed.
