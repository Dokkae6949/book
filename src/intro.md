# Introduction

Welcome to the Rusty Wayland Handbook.

This book is related to the [wayland-client](https://crates.io/crates/wayland-client) and
[wayland-server](https://crates.io/crates/wayland-server) rust crates, and will detail how to use
them to build wayland apps and compositors.

The [first section](./wayland/intro.html) is a general introduction on the Wayland protocol, its
goals and architecture.

The [second section](./client/intro.html) is dedicated to the building of client apps, that can
run natively in any wayland environment.

The [third section](./server/intro.html) focuses on build compositors (or wayland servers), that
act as both window managers and display servers.

Have a good read!
